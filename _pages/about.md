I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. Laura Balzano and Prof. Qing Qu. Previously, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Rutgers University, where I worked with Prof. Anand D. Sarwate.

I am interested in a wide range of problems, from theoretical deep learning to practical and efficient algorithms for generative models. I have worked on post-training algorithms for LLM reasoning tasks, theoretical analyses of in-context learning, and diffusion models for solving inverse problems.
