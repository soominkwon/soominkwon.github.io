%% Recitation #1 Code:
%% Activity 1:

variable_one = 5;
variable_two = "5";

new_variable_one = variable_one + 2;
new_variable_two = variable_two + 2;

% Check the difference between the two answers. It is important
% to keep track of which datatype your variables are so that you get
% the correct result of what you want, which is 7.

%% Activity 2:

decimal = 2.5;
double_row_array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
double_column_array = [1; 2; 3; 4];
character = 'a';
string = "hello";
new_numerical = decimal * 2;

% The purpose of this activity was for you to get familar with constructing
% different datatypes.

%% Activity 4:

% Circumference of a circle: 2 * pi * r
% Area of a circle: pi * r^2
% Volumne of a sphere: (4/3) * pi * r^3
radius = 5;

circumference = 2 * pi * radius;
area = pi * radius^2;
volume = (4/3) * pi * radius^3;
